# Survival_Analysis
Obtaining Hazard Function Graph of different Distribution

This Survival_analysis repository showcases my implementation of various survival analysis models using R. Specifically, it focuses on the Weibull, Gompertz, Gompertz-Makeham, Log-Normal, and Log-Logistic distribution hazard functions. Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze time-to-event data, often applied in medical research, reliability engineering, and other fields. In this project, I have developed code to visualize and compare the hazard functions associated with these different distributions. By leveraging R's rich ecosystem of packages such as survival, flexsurv, and ggplot2, I have created informative plots that demonstrate the varying shapes and characteristics of the hazard functions. Through this repository, I aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for understanding and analyzing survival data using different hazard functions. The project highlights my proficiency in survival analysis techniques and showcases the versatility of R for conducting complex statistical modeling tasks.
